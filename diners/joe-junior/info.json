    "intro": "Many argue that Joe Junior makes the best burger in New York, and it’s what originally put Joe Junior on my radar. But it takes a lot more than a single signature dish to go from a decent restaurant to your favorite diner. Unfortunately I haven’t had the opportunity to try Joe Juniors legendary burger, and it would be unfair to call this review complete with such a major piece missing. So consider my opinion partially incomplete until I return to try out their burger. Fortunately for Joe Junior, they have more going for them than just burger-hype."
