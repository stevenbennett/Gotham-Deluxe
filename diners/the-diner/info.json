    "intro": "The Diner is a popular and accessible diner located in the middle of the Meatpacking District. Crowds of locals and tourists frequent the area, and you’ll find a healthy mix of both at The Diner. The size, menu, and hours are perfect for this sort of area, there’s lots of indoor and outdoor seating, the menu is appropriately big and varied, and the hours are well thought out. It sounds like a perfect combination of quintessential diners elements, but for a place that calls itself ‘The Diner’ it’s far from perfect, and far from what I would consider the quintessential diner."
