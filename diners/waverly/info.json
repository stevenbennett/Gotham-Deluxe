    "intro": "Just around the corner from Washington Square is this unassuming 24/7 diner with a couple of surprises. Waverly, or Waverly Restaurant, is a traditional American diner with a menu that has a noticeably Greek influence. It's a twenty-four seven diner that seems to be a late night favorite for this neighborhood. It’s also one of the cleanest and strangest diners I’ve ever been to."
