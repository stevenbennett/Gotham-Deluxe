                    <p>The first of these details I picked up on was a smattering of art-deco inspired (I think…) features of Remedy’s interior. The fixture above the bar is just decoration but it really looks great, it has these vertical stainless steel bands that make you feel like you’re somewhere in or under the Chrysler building. Even the ceiling fans have this tapered, faceted design that makes it seems like they're striving for the same mid-century look. There are lots of other little examples like this. The lighting on the walls is another good one, and you can’t really look anywhere without seeing some tasteful stainless steel accent. Combined, these little decorative details make for an interior that’s nostalgic and comfortable but feels nice and intentional.</p>

                    <p>Another thing: the walls on one side that open completely to the outside. This isn’t so much of a detail, it was the first thing I noticed about Remedy after it’s flashy signage. They didn’t seem to have dedicated outdoor seating, but the indoor-outdoor seating next to the open wall was ridiculously pleasant.</p>

                    <p>On to the food. I got a cheeseburger and fries, somewhat of a standardized test for judging diners, and though it arrived quite a bit later than I expected, Remedy continued to deliver its little surprising details. The burger (made deluxe and a little expensive by adding fries, tomatoes, lettuce, pickle, and coleslaw) was arranged as if they knew I was going to have to take photographs of it. It even had some sort of green garnish sprinkled on it that made it look extra delicious.</p>

                    <p>The fries were shockingly good. I let out an unexpected but audible “woah” when I first tried them. I don’t know what it was about the fries, maybe I was just craving them at the time, but they tasted so, so delicious. The cheeseburger was disappointing but by no means bad. It was disappointing because the patty was way above average and the bun was dry and crumbly and hovering just below average. With a good bun this would have been an five-star meal. I bet it would give <a href="/diners/joe-junior"><span>Joe Junior's</span></a> famous burger a run for its money.</p>

                        <p>I was stuffed and I only got this banana cream pie because I figured Remedy would make it look great and I wanted to take a picture of it. They didn't meet my expectations with this one. The plate is just too ugly. Plus it wasn't very tasty. Too bad.</p>

                    <p>The staff was awesome too, they were really attentive and friendly. Someone at the table next to us was acting like a bit of a jerk about their order, and still the waiter treated them really well. When traffic started to pick up, the servers continued to periodically make their way to our table to check-in. It’s pretty simple but there are places like <a href="/diners/la-bonbonniere"><span>La Bonbonniere</span></a> that don’t do this.</p>
