    "blurb": "La Bonbonniere is an old-school, alternative diner known for its hearty breakfast, ecletctic atmosphere, and hip neighborhood.",
    "intro": "This breakfast-centric diner is a mashup of a hip brunch spot and a traditional comfort food restaurant, and it inherits the strengths and weaknesses of each. It has the sprawling menu of a diner and the energetic environment of a New York brunch place that makes your visit feel less like a meal and more an event. In a prime area of the West Village, one of the few neighborhoods in Manhattan that is best described as “pretty”, it’s a little, eclectic diner that’s unapologetically not pretty. Those looking for a fast, reliable, greasy breakfast will probably be satisfied here, but I think they’re also aiming to serve the crowd that sees breakfast (more specifically brunch) as more of a weekend event. La Bonbonniere fills both of these roles pretty well, but I think the some of it's hip brunch qualities are colliding with and damaging some essential diner qualities."
