    "intro": "Square Diner is one of the rare remaining standalone diners in New York, and it sits among a crowd of skyscrapers and warehouses in TriBeCa. I love the atmosphere of standalone diners, it’s like a little isolated experience that's separated from the rest of the city. Square Diner has a lost to prove as so many other standalone diners are closing. It's trying really hard to be memorable and I think sometimes it goes to far, but in the end it's a standalone diner worthy of its little footprint."
